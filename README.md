
## File Breakdown

### 1. **variables.tf**
Defines all configurable parameters like region, VPC CIDR, ECS task size, and EFS throughput mode.

### 2. **data.tf**
Retrieves information about the default VPC, its subnets, and the latest Ubuntu AMI from Canonical.


Creates:
- A security group for EFS.
- An EFS file system with a lifecycle policy.
- Mount targets in all default subnets.
- An EFS access point with its root directory set to `/nginx/conf.d`.

### 5. **ec2-helper.tf**
Creates an EC2 instance (the configuration uploader) that:
- Uses an Ubuntu AMI.
- Mounts the EFS file system.
- Creates the `/nginx/conf.d` directory.
- Writes the custom NGINX configuration file (`default.conf`) to that directory.
- Unmounts the EFS after ensuring the file is written.


Defines IAM roles for ECS:
- **ECS Task Execution Role:** Grants ECS permissions to pull container images, send logs, and use ECS Exec.
- **ECS Task Role:** Grants in-container permissions (e.g., for EFS access) and attaches the AmazonElasticFileSystemClientReadWriteAccess policy.
- Also attaches an inline policy to the execution role for ECS Exec functionality.

Uses data sources to reference the default VPC and subnets. (In this example, weâ€™re using the default VPC provided by AWS.)
Creates:
- An ECS Cluster.
- A security group for ECS tasks to allow HTTP traffic.
- An ECS Task Definition that defines a container running NGINX. The container mounts the EFS volume (via the access point) at `/etc/nginx/conf.d`, so that NGINX loads the custom configuration.
- An ECS Service that runs on Fargate in public subnets with a public IP and has ECS Exec enabled for debugging.

### 8. **outputs.tf**
Defines outputs that provide:
- The ECS cluster ID.
- The ECS service name.
- The public IP of the EC2 configuration uploader (for debugging if needed).
